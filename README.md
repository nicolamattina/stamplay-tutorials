## Using the examples

Every example is a set of files that you only need to upload on you app on stamplay.com.

In order to start clone this repository :

    git clone git@github.com:Stamplay/stamplay-tutorials

Or download it as a zip file
	
	https://github.com/Stamplay/stamplay-tutorials/archive/master.zip 

 upload the frontend files in your app and you can do it in two ways:

* Copy/Upload them via the Layout section of your app on Stamplay editor
